}
```

## Validation

The supported examination formats are slash-separated and comma-separated formats, e.g., S1187/0142/2022 or S1187.0142.2022. The package handles validation for you.

## Supported years

Currently, we support all years between 2015 and 2023, except for 2016.

## Error

If the student is not found, 404 status code will be returned. For any other error, a code of 500 will be returned.

If, for any reason, you encounter the following error:

```
Could not find a version of the package alexleotz/necta-results-scraper matching your minimum-stability (stable). Require it with an explicit version constraint allowing its desired stability.
```

Create a new composer file (if none exists) and add the following line:

```json
"minimum-stability": "stable"
```

Then, install this package again.
